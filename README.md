# Etch-a-Sketch
So I just took a look at the other submissions for this project. Suffice to say that my attempt at this project is the most barebones approach. I feel that the key here was using loops in order to create the div size occupy the same amount of space. My solution incorporated the use of the viewport dimensions and dividing the size of the divs by the square root (i.e 256 = 16 by 16).

This was enjoyable but I know that much more effort could be put into this. Looking forward to my next projects.
